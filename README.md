Washington State Counties Population Change 2000-2010

The goal of this project was to display changes in population over the entirety of Washington, county by county. By using WA Public Land Survey Data, I was able to display the amount of people gained or loss in each county. A change in population for each county is associated with a different color. Each county is colored a certain way to represent the number of people they have gained or lost in overall population from 2000-2010. The darker the red that the county is the more overall people that county has gained while the lighter colors resemble a smaller increase in the overall population. If a county&#39;s overall population has decreased over the years so that there is a negative change in people, then the county is represented by a black fill color. Each county is highlighted when the cursor is placed over it and when clicked, a popup appears revealing the county name and the exact population gain/loss for that specific county. An acknowledgment tab is included at the bottom right for leaflet, OpenStreetMap&#39;s, and the WA public Land Service. Additionally, a scale is located at the bottom left of the screen. Future updates for this map will include locations of major technology firms such as Microsoft and Amazon to help discover further trends within Washington&#39;s populations.
